  <p>We are
  asking you to participate in a research study titled “Urban Noise: Effects on
  Physical and Mental Health”. We will describe this study to you and answer any
  of your questions.&nbsp; This study is being led by Kimberly Riegel, Department
  of physics at Queensborough Community College.</p>

  <p><strong>What the study is about</strong></p>

  <p>The purpose of this study is to correlate urban sound levels and noises to
  annoyance levels and incidents of chronic health problems.&nbsp; We are trying
  to obtain large amounts of data in a variety of listening environments and from
  a variety of listeners to determine the correlations between several key
  factors which are historically difficult to capture.&nbsp; These parameters
  include physical health history, mental health history, annoyance, sound level
  exposure, characteristics of the sound and types of sound.</p>

  <p><b>What we will ask you to do</b></p>

  <p>We will ask you to download the Auditive app to your cell phone. If you agree to
  participate in this study you will then be asked a
  series of medical and mental health history questions. Once you have
  completed that survey you will be asked to measure the sound levels throughout
  your day. You may make as many sound measurements as you would
  like. After each measurement a short three question survey asking about
  your perception and annoyance of the sound will be given. Once this
  survey is complete the sound file as well as your responses will be sent to a
  central server the next time your phone is connected to a wifi network.</p>

  <p><strong>Risks and discomforts</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>

  <p>There are no direct benefits to the respondent at this time.</p>

  <p>Information from this study will be used to offer some
  guidance to urban planners and environmental engineers to focus on particular
  sounds that cause physical and mental hardships on a community scale.</p>

  <p><strong>Compensation for participation </strong></p>

  <p>There is no compensation for participation.</p>

  <p><strong>Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security</strong></p>

  <p>All participants will be assigned a random ID number and no
  personal identifiable information will be uploaded to the central server for
  use in the study. The data will be stored in a secure amazon bucket and
  then downloaded and stored on a secured external hard drive. This drive
  will be stored on the QCC campus. The survey is conducted through the
  campus provided Microsoft forms service.

  It should be noted that location information will be sent along with your sound data.
  This will be used to identify neighborhood as well as proximity to regular noise sources.</p>

  <p><strong>Sharing De-identified Data Collected in this Research</strong></p>

  <p>De-identified
  data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to
  advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information
  that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to
  ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be
  able to identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we
  cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.</p>

  <p><strong>Taking part is voluntary</strong></p>

  <p>Your
  participation in this survey is voluntary. You can refuse to participate
  before the study begins or discontinue your involvement at any time. You
  will not be penalized in any way for not participating in this study.</p>

  <p><strong>If you have questions</strong></p>

  <p>The main
  researcher conducting this study is Kimberly Riegel, a professor at Queensborough
  Community College. If you have any questions related to the research you may contact Kimberly Riegel at kriegel@qcc.cuny.edu or at
